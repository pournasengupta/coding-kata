> Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0’s and 1’s. How many n-digit binary numbers are there that don’t have two adjacent 1 bits? For example, here are the three-digit numbers:
>
> **000 001 010011 100 101110 111**
> 
> Five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria
> 
> What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?
